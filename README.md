# TTT-Latex
A Time-To-Target Plot developed in Java for the generation of Tikz Pgfplot figures for Latex

This Java program allows you to generate Time-To-Target Plots. TTT Plots are an tool for empirically determining if 
a given method is more efficient than another. TTT Plots are widely explained in this link:

Actually, TTT-Latex just follows the directions of the previous link. However, TTT-Latex generates the Tikz pgfplot code
for the input data, so you can just copy this code on your Latex document inside a figure environment.

This first version is very simple. Next versions are going to have the possibility of fitting the obtained discrete plot
to a continuous exponential distribution.
